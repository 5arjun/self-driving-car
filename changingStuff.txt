Change sensor stuff: 
    sensor.js 
    (constructor): 
        this.car = car;
        this.rayCount = 3; // Number of rays to cast
        this.rayLength = 100; // Length of each ray
        this.raySpread = Math.PI / 4; // 45 degrees
    ctx.lineWidth = 1.5; //how thick each sensor is
    ctx.strokeStyle = "yellow"; //color of sensor

    car.js (constructor):
    this.speed = 0;
    this.acceleration = 0.2;
    this.maxSpeed = 3;
    this.friction = 0.05;
    this.angle = 0;

    main.js: 
    const car = new Car(road.getLaneCenter(1), 100, 30, 50);
        road.getLaneCenter(1): which lane car stars in
        30: width of the car
        50: length of the car
    ctx.translate(0,-car.y+canvas.height*0.7);
        0.7: the position on y coord where car remains stationary
    
    road.js 
    (constructor) laneCount
    ctx.setLineDash([20, 20]);
        first 20: length of white part of lane
        second 20: length of blank part of lane
